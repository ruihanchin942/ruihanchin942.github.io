The project idea is proposed by another group of students from the course DECO3801 in The University of Queensland, then it was handled to my team to build this idea from scratch during the course DECO3801. It was assumed that sufficient research has been done to propose this idea. CatsEG aims to help Australian grade 7 and 9 studnets to learn better using gamifications, rather than the tradiational way of learning from papers. This project involved in building and integrating Unity game and website as a platform. I am participating with a team of 6 members, resposible for creating the pages (using skills HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, PHP) and managing backend database as a full stack developer with another member.

The main purpose of this project was to develop a number of prototypes as a means of evaluating conceptual and functional aspects of an idea. Provided with a list of challenges, I chose to design a game that encapsulates the concepts and ideas. This game was developed for playing with VR equipments, which combined both physical and digital media and consider alternative forms of interactions - specifically non-traditional, novel physical interactions (no keyboard, mouse, or existing game controller). The game is call Puppiness, which player will needed to wear an Oculus VR headset to play. The main objective is to use the gun the player holds and transform the wolves into cute puppies by shooting a chicken drumstick as the bullet.
