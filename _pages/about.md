* **CatsEG** Full Stack Development (Aug 2020 - Present)   
CatsEG is a website for grade 6 and 7 Australian students to better enhance their learning in academics through gamifications. The project idea is proposed by another group of students from the course DECO3800 in The University of Queensland, then it was handled to my team to build this idea from scratch during the course DECO3801. It was assumed that sufficient research has been done to propose this idea. CatsEG aims to help Australian grade 6 and 7 studnets to learn better using gamifications, rather than the tradiational way of learning from papers. This project involved in building and integrating Unity game and website as a platform. I am participating with a team of 6 members, resposible for creating the pages (using skills HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, PHP) and managing backend database as a full stack developer with another member.
  * Adopting pure PHP for web pages development and PhpMyAdmin as database management system.
